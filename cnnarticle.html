    <h1>Rat Infestation Plagues New Zealand Suburb</h1>
    <h2>By Julia Hollingsworth, CNN - June 17, 2019</h2>

    <p><img src="rat.jpg" alt="A file image of a rat"></img> The rodent species has infested a New Zealand town. (CNN) â€” A beachside New Zealand suburb known for roaming chickens and yoga has become infested with unwelcome guests: large, writhing rats.</p>

    <p>The rodents -- which have swarmed around shops and houses in the artsy west Auckland suburb of Titirangi -- have made headlines in New Zealand recently, where local media have described them as "cat-sized" and "brazen."</p>

    <p><i>Local reporter Don Rowe</i> said he <b>saw 30 to 40 rats within a 20-minute period</b> when he went out to the area last week.</p>

    <p>"<i>They were sort of writhing around in the brush and feasting on little bits of grain</i>," he told CNN. "<i>They've never been as brazen or in as high a number. They were crawling over the roots and in and out of trees, just a tide of them... They were not afraid of people at all, not afraid of vehicles.</i>"</p>

    <p>Earlier this month, the <i>Titirangi Residents and Ratepayers Association</i> posted on their Facebook, saying the <b>rats were "running all over the village in broad daylight."</b></p>

    <p>Suburban Titirangi has long been <b>home to a large population of wild chickens</b>, and residents believe that the <b>rats may have been fattening up on chicken feed</b> left for the stray birds, said <i>Greg Presland, the chairperson of the Waitakere Ranges Local Board</i> which administers Titirangi.</p>

    <p><i>Presland</i> said he expected to <b>release a plan in the next couple of days to deal with the chicken and rat populations.</b> "<i>Everyone hates the rats</i>," he added.</p>

    <p>The infestation has also <b>divided the local community.</b> While some residents are concerned about the influx of rodents, <b>others believed the rat plague has been overblown</b> by those hoping to use it as an excuse to <b>get rid of Titirangi's population of wild chickens</b> -- or to <b>justify the use of the pesticide 1080</b>, which has been met with some opposition in New Zealand.</p>

    <p>"<i>There's not much you can do without wiping out anything that's scurrying around</i>," <i>Rowe</i> said, referring to how <b>using 1080 would also kill off the chicken population.</b> "<i>They (the rats) breed so fast and there's so many of them -- (the locals are) playing Whac-a-mole with the rats.</i>"</p>

    <h3>A Bigger Problem</h3>

    <p>Titirangi is just the tip of the iceberg of a much <b>bigger problem in New Zealand</b>, said <i>Kevin Hackwell, the chief conservation adviser at Forest and Bird</i>, a conservation organization.</p>

    <p><i>Hackwell</i> attributed the rat influx to a <b>so-called mega-mast</b>, the <b>country's biggest in 40 years.</b> In New Zealand, <b>native plants don't always seed every year</b>. <b>Every few years, all species of one tree will seed at once</b> -- something called a "mega-mast."</p>

    <p>Historically, New Zealand was a <b>land of birds</b> -- <b>the only native mammals are bats</b> -- and a mega-mast would have been good for native bird populations. But now, it's <b>rodents that feed on the additional seeds and fruits</b>, meaning their <b>populations soar into the millions.</b> Consequently, <b>native bird populations are affected</b> as the rats <b>feed on bird eggs</b>, explained <i>Hackwell</i>.</p>

    <p>"<i>What used to be a great year for wildlife... has now become a devastating year for wildlife</i>," he said, adding that <b>since humans arrived in the country, 43 species of birds have gone extinct.</b> "<i>There will be millions and millions and millions of rats and mice -- no question.</i>"</p>

    <p>The primary cause of the mega-mast is <b>global warming</b>, according to <i>Hackwell</i>. As temperatures rise, the <b>frequency of major masting events has increased</b>, intensifying the problem.</p>

    <p>"<i>Climate change is already having a huge impact on our biodiversity</i>," <i>Hackwell</i> asserted. "<i>In a mega-mast year, all hell breaks loose for our native wildlife.</i>"</p>
