Wait, you're not Katie! You must have found her box...I guess the decision is up to you now. Katie was a researcher at C Five biotech, and she was very active in our local community. She was trying to help out with a chicken crisis, now you have the choice to preserve her research or destroy it. Take a look in her box, because it is not as simple as it sounds. When you are ready to make a choice, you can provide me with one of the command codes she left behind. I was also a good friend of Katie's, so you can ask me questions about her or things you find in the box.
